# How to make zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip").

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

* First bullet
* Second bullet


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
fmt.Println("Hello world!)
}
```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that look like `code`?

And when I hace a URL I want it to print also so I slways write it out like this:

https://google.com

* I put references at the bottom
